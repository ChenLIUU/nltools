Neurovault I/O
===========
Data can be easily downloaded and uploaded to neurovault.



Download a Collection
---------------------------------------------------------

Entire collections from neurovault can be downloaded along with the
accompanying image metadata.  You just need to know the collection ID.



.. code-block:: python


    from nltools.datasets import download_collection
    from nltools.data import Brain_Data

    metadata,files = download_collection(collection=2099)
    mask = Brain_Data(files,X=metadata)







Download a Single Image from the Web
---------------------------------------------------------

It's possible to load a single image from a web URL using the Brain_Data 
load method.  The files are downloaded to a temporary directory and will 
eventually be erased by your computer so be sure to write it out to a file 
if you would like to save it.  Here we plot it using nilearn's glass brain
function.



.. code-block:: python


    from nilearn.plotting import plot_glass_brain

    mask = Brain_Data('http://neurovault.org/media/images/2099/Neurosynth%20Parcellation_0.nii.gz')

    plot_glass_brain(mask.to_nifti())

Upload Data to Neurovault
---------------------------------------------------------

There is a method to easily upload a Brain_Data() instance to 
http://neurovault.org.  This requires using your api key, which can be found
under your account settings.  Anything stored in data.X will be uploaded as
image metadata.  The required fields include collection_name, the img_type,
img_modality, and analysis_level.  See https://github.com/neurolearn/pyneurovault_upload
for additional information.



.. code-block:: python


    api_key = 'your_neurovault_api_key'

    # mask.upload_neurovault(access_token=api_key, collection_name='Neurosynth Parcellation', 
    #                        img_type='Pa', img_modality='Other',analysis_level='M')
