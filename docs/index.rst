`NLTools <https://github.com/ljchang/neurolearn>`_ is a Python package for analyzing neuroimaging data.  It is the analysis engine powering `neuro-learn <http://neuro-learn.org>`_ There are tools to perform data manipulation and analyses such as univariate GLMs, predictive multivariate modeling, and representational similarity analyses.  It is based loosely off of Tor Wager's `object-oriented Matlab toolbox <https://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore>`_ and leverages much code from `nilearn <http://nilearn.github.io/>`_ and  `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org>`_
